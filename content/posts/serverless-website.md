### Overview

So you've come to a point where you want to build yourself a simple static website to front your business, any myraid of personal reasons, or even start a personal blog.

While there are literally tons of ways to deploy a site like this, it doesn't need to be complex or expensive. In fact, I will go over how you can create a nearly free website just like this one (or maybe even better if you spend more time developing the site than I do) using free tools that are available to you.

### Generating Static Content

If you're like me and not a front end dev, you can check out some great static content generators to create your site such as Jekyll and Hugo. Being already familiar with Hugo, I chose to use this project. You can head over to https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/ and get started in minutes. Once you've configured your static content and familiarized yourself with Hugo's folder structure, you'll notice in the Config.toml file you have the ability to push your content to a cloud provider, our next step.
